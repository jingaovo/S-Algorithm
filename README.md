## What is S Algorithm?
S Algorithm is a quantitative portfolio construction tool in python that selects stocks with the optimal weight that minimizes the total volatility of the portfolio

The Algorithm is primarily designed for clients aimed at stable return.
## Key Features
-	Implemented standard deviation, covariance, Sharpe ratio, and effective frontier analysis to evaluate the risks of each stock by utilizing technology including Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and yahoo finance
- This optimization algorithm has shown success in the real world, as it outperformed all other strategies suggested by peers in a 4 week test.
## Teck Stack
S Algorithm is mainly built by Python and utilizes various Python libraries to optimize its functionality.

Libraries Used: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Yahoo Finance
